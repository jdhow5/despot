# despot
In this repository you will find the binary for DESpot, a discrete-event system (DES) software research tool.  
Also included is my contribution to DESpot, the Regression Test Suite.  
All major code I have written is included in the repository.  The user interface files were designed using Qt Designer.
To launch the Regression Test Suite, click on the "Projects" menu, then "New Regression Test".
