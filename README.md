# DESpot
In this repository you will find the code I have written for DESpot, a discrete-event system (DES) software research tool.  My contribution includes a regression testing suite that allows future developers to ensure their modifications to DESpot's system checking algorithms provide the correct results and do not introduce new bugs.  

The regression test suite was developed with C++ and Qt 5.8.  I used Qt Creator as the IDE and Qt Designer to create the user interface forms.

For more information about DESpot and its use, development, and a download of the latest version please visit:

Note: the regression test suite may not be included in the latest release of DESpot until it is added to the complete release by the owner.
